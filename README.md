This repository is a collection of Cheat Sheets for programming languages and
tools.  Currently:

* A [Haskell Cheat Sheet] -- "beta" version
* A Template Cheat Sheet
* A LaTeX cls file, for the creation of sheets.

	* If you think something must be added and there is no space: consider removing something
* *Simple to read*: they do *not* aim to *teach* you how to use something, but simply
