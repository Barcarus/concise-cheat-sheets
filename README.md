Compiling
---------

Clone the project, then:

    cd ./ultimate-cheat-sheets
    make



Features
--------

* No more than **2 pages long**: adhering to the dictionary definition of a sheet of paper.
	* Look at the [C Reference Card] by J. H. Silverman for a good example
	* If you think something must be added and there is no space: consider removing something
* **Simple to read**: they do **not** aim to **teach** you how to use something, but simply
  **remind you** of syntax, functions or caveats.
* Made in LaTeX using a **simple 3 column format**.
* Licensed under **CC-BY-SA** 3.0 or **GNU FDL** 1.3  (at your option)  unless otherwise stated.
	* The `refcard.cls` file and the template are licensed under the **LPPL**.
