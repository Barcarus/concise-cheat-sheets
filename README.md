* Simple to read: they do not aim to teach you how to use something, but simply
  remind you of syntax, functions or caveats.
* Made in LaTeX using a simple 3 column format.
* Licensed under CC-BY-SA 3.0 or GNU FDL 1.3  (at your option)  unless otherwise stated.
	* The `refcard.cls` file and the template are licensed under the LPPL.
