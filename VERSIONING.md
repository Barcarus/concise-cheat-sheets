Ultimate Cheat Sheets versioning scheme
=======================================

UCS class file uses [Semantic Versioning 2.0] with an addendum:

Since we're hosting different Cheat Sheets, they all get versioned separately.
Also, cheat sheets themselves don't have the patch component.

The general tags of the repository, denoted by v0.1.3, v0.2.1 or v1.0.0 regards
the class file and template.

The tags haskell-v0.1, haskell-v0.2, haskell-v0.3, regards the haskell-ucs.tex
cheat sheet.

The tag something-v0.1, something-v0.2, etc, regards something-ucs.tex.

[Semantic Versioning 2.0]: http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html
